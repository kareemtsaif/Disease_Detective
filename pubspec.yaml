# # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# # Read more about iOS versioning at

# # In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# # of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

#   # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#   assets:
#     - assets/images/
#     - assets/icons/

#   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

#   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
#   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   fonts:
#     - family: Source Sans Pro
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf
#         - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Bold.ttf
#         # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#         #   style: italic
#   #   - family: Trajan Pro
